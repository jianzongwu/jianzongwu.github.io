<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **Jianzong Wu (吴健宗)** and I am a **PhD Student** at [School of Intelligence Science and Technology](https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yunhai Tong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=T4gqdPkAAAAJ). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).

My research interest focuses on multi-modal learning, including feature alignment, scene understanding and content generation. So far, I have conducted research works on referring image segmentation, open vocabulary image segmentation, text-to-image editting task, multi-modal large language models, as well as several related fields.
